Knight Battleground Game
This is a Python program that allows you to create and manage a list of knights with their attributes such as name, age, armor color, and power level. Additionally, you can simulate battles between knights based on their power levels.

How to Play
To play the game, simply run the program in your Python environment. You will be presented with a menu of options:

Create a new knight: Create a new knight and add them to the list of knights.
Update your knight: Select an existing knight from the list and update their attributes.
Battle the knights! Simulate a battle between the knights in the list based on their power levels and display the winner.
Exit: Quit the game.
To make a selection, enter the number corresponding to the option you want to choose.

If you select "Create a new knight," you will be prompted to enter the knight's name, age, armor color, and power level. Once you have entered this information, the knight will be added to the list, and you will be shown a list of all the knights that have been created so far.

If you select "Update your knight," you will be prompted to select a knight from the list and then enter new values for their name, age, armor color, and power level. Once you have entered the new values, the knight's attributes will be updated, and you will be shown the updated list of all knights.

If you select "Battle the knights!," the program will determine which knight has the highest power level and display their name and power level as the winner.

If you select "Exit," the program will end.
